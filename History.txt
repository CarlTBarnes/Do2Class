===================== Do2Class History ===================== 
02-05-21.1500   On Problems tab remind can insert "Do2Class_STOP ROUTINE" to prevent "? Return was in Routine ?"
                Put Icons on Tabs if they need attention like Problems
                Fix Implicit search finding Pictures like @N$9 which N$ looked like a Real   
                Tag Implicit !@# new State 3 Gray box skips A-Z#. They are used a lot for LOOP X#. 
                        I added this feature for about 30 lines. I probably should have reviewed those lines.
                        I used a STATE3 Checkbox to Omit A-Z#, this is not the right use for that control :(

07-07-20.1255   
            Quick hack that if "Do2Class_STOP ROUTINE" exists then code below that is not processed
                  which allows existing LocalProcedure embeds to be moved up into Routines embeds
                  but they are not processed. Not pretty but worked in a 9000 line TXA with 19 routines

07-02-20.1215   VersionDo2Class EQUATE('Do2Class Version 07-02-20.1215')
            Added Edit button next to Load TXA. Want to sometimes see the TXA text.
            Added Explorer button next to Load TXA to open folder in explorer.

07-01-20.1750   VersionDo2Class EQUATE('Do2Class Version 07-01-20.1750') 
            Added VersionDo2Class EQUATE() and put in Caption 
            Added [GROUP] section (code template) to TXA Parse class. 
            Right-click popup "Copy Text" on most lists.
            Warn if there are already Local Procedure Embeds and suggest moving to Routines so convert works better.,

            CbTxaClass add new Property .FromTemplate to know if REPORT or PROCESS

            DDD.EditSaveFn PROCEDURE() to open TXA in Editor. EXE name and swicthes from Editor.INI file
            Warning if file had no Routines, and suggest they may be in %LocalProcedures ... incorrectly
            Cosmetic changes
